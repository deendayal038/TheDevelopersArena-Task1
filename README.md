The Student Information System is a simple Java-based console application designed to manage and maintain basic student records efficiently. The system stores student details such as ID, Name, Age, Grade, and Contact Number and allows users to perform essential operations like adding, viewing, searching, and updating student information.
This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, collections, and user input handling in Java. It is suitable for academic purposes and helps in understanding how real-world data management systems work at a basic level.

Objectives of the Project:
1) To store student details in an organized manner
2) To provide easy access to student records
3) To allow searching of students using a unique student ID
4) To enable updating of existing student information
5) To practice Java fundamentals and object-oriented programming
